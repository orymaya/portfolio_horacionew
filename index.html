     <p>This Web Portfolio includes examples of my work in Mr. Lanus' Web Design class. It also includes my reflections (below) on what I learned in each unit of the course.</p>

     <h2>Unit 1:HTML</h2>
     <!--ad reflection answer below-->
       <p>  </p>
       <p>  </p>
       <p>  </p>
       <p>  </p>
   <h2>Unit 1: Designing & Planning Web Pages</h2>
   <p>
    <p> I think the most important vocabulary are these: tags, elements, body,
      and head </p>
    <p> I think the most important thing I learned that if you dont close or type
      the right thing it can change everything that you have done. </p>
    <p> I've gotten better in understanding the things i have to do. I understand
      that everything has to be perfect or it wont come out the way you want it to. </p>
    <p> I need to improve in many ways because I am not compleatly sure what I am
      doing but I do have a clue what i'm doing. </p>
    <p> I encounterd the font sizes and the color of the font being differnt then
      the way I want it to be. </p>

   <h2>Unit 2: Creating Pages with HTML</h2>
    <p> I think that the most important vocabulary term is CSS because without that we wouldent be able to add any styles to the page.</p>
<p>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</p>
<p>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work? </p>
<p>In what ways do you think you need to improve?</p>
<p>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</p>
<p>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</p>
<p>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</p>
